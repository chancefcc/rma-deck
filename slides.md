# 1. Executive Summary

-   **Vision**: To establish a **data-driven B2B payment and finance service** for high-tech cross-border trade, transforming traditional payment and financing mechanisms.
-   **Key Partners**: This initiative is a strategic partnership between **RMAICT**, **Tikoly.com**, and **Breakpoints.live**..
-   **Problem Addressed**: Traditional cross-border supply chains lack transparency and trust regarding delivery, performance, and quality, leading to high intermediation costs, price uncertainty, and slow, costly manual payment systems.
-   **Our Solution**: RMA Finance leverages a **hybrid model of on-chain data verification and off-chain compliant settlement** on Solana.
    -   Utilizes Tikoly.com's decentralized data oracle marketplace and RMAICT’s extensive IT solutions experience.
    -   Employs the **Solana blockchain for a transparent, auditable partner-to-partner ledger**.
    -   Leverages China banks' **CIPS clearing service for compliant final settlement** in cross-border transactions, starting with Malaysia.
-   **Core Value**: To provide **unprecedented trust and efficiency** to traditionally illiquid supply chains, bridging traditional finance with new-age digital services.

# 2. Solution and Projects (1/2)

### Tikoly Network: A Decentralized Verification Layer
-   **Core Mission**: To solve the _trust bottleneck_ in verifying off-chain energy data by replacing trusted intermediaries with **cryptographic proofs using Zero-Knowledge Proofs over TLS (zkTLS)**.
-   **Key Offerings**: Provides Real World Asset (RWA) data oracles, Application-to-Application (A2A) smart contracts, and a robust Solana Program Library (SPL) ledger-based ecosystem.
-   **Tokenomics**: Employs a **multi-token system on Solana**:
    -   **TIKO**: The native utility token, primary medium of exchange, base liquidity asset, and instrument for staking and governance.
    -   **FTIKO (Forward TIKO)**: Project-specific SPL tokens representing verifiable claims on future kWh of electricity, used by energy producers to raise capital upfront.
    - **PayFi** running on the risk-balanced **Dual Flow Batch Auction (DFBA)**: A specialized mechanism for value exchange (payments), designed for large, illiquid, and project-based assets, preventing front-running and ensuring uniform pricing.

# 2. Solution and Projects (2/2)

### Project tiktag.app: The Edge Data & Solution Platform
TikTag.app provides an integrated platform for solar panel installers and vendors, streamlining solution design and product catalog management.
-  **TikTag Studio**: AI tools for speeding up vendors and installers collaboration on renewable energy solutions.
- **Verifiable Impact**: Makes operational data accessible and verifiable, building "trustless trust" with donors by providing auditable proof of asset operation and social impact (e.g., in _Project Volta_ smart cooker donations) .
-  **Data Integrity & Privacy**: Ensures data integrity through **on-chain proof anchoring** for database states and uses **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** for completeness and commercial privacy.
-  **Duo-Token System**: Utilizes **TIK (Utility Token)** for computational costs of AI simulations and **TAG (Solution Token)** for confirmed, verified, and actionable solutions stored persistently.
-  **Tiktag Node Staking**: Data-staking and tokenomics to enable renewable system SKU knowledge exchanges.

# 3. ROI and Roadmap (1/3)

### RMA Finance Advantages & ROI
-   **Data-Backed Financing**: The _PayFi_ approach enables financing based on future income or receivables, leveraging Tikoly.com's data oracle service for project-specific risk assessment and token valuation.
-   **Target Market**: Focuses on **less liquid and more opaque markets** like futures for farm produce, renewable energy projects, and recycled materials, where tokenization provides maximum efficiency gains.
-   **Efficiency & Transparency**: Offers a superior service that is **faster, cheaper, and more transparent** due to its hybrid model of on-chain data verification and off-chain compliant settlement.
-   **Automated Payment Orchestration**: Solana smart contracts act as a coordination layer, triggering compliant payment messages to traditional clearing systems (CIPS) when on-chain conditions are met.
